App for sniffing promising stocks from stock market.
Currently supports nasdaq stock list and xetra instrument list for importing.
Nasdq stocks use [Alpha Vantage API](http://www.alphavantage.co) for historical data.
All symbols can be searched with Google Finance scraper for more details etc.  

Goal is to expand scraping more for more in-depth analysis per stock. (And maybe between stock relations. Who knows?)
